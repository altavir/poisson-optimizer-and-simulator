# Poisson Optimizer and Simulator

Using poisson distribution to simulate staffing headcount decisions and impact on wait times.

## Abstract

You need to decide how many bank tellers `x` to staff for a given work shift period `t_shift`. 

During this period, there is an average of `c` customers per hour. There is also an average processing time `t_processing` for each customer.

Create a simulator that accepts these parameters and animates the outcome over a specific period.
